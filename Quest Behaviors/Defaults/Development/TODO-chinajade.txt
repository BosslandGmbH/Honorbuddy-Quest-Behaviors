TODO:
* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
	+ In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs are not taken out first.
	+ Need to beef up EscortGroup to allow for target priority
	+ Have Kick replace 30625-FourWinds-StudentsNoMore.cs with EscortGroup.cs

* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.
 
* ButtonPressOnChat, (request from Laria):
	hey there, could you extend buttonpressonchat with a small auraid check,
	"if i have this aura, don't interact with gameobject/npc anymore because we already are in the event"?
	it also might need fixes due to new actionbar code,
	for me wow says "you can't do that" and no buttons seem to be pressed

* InteractWith needs a complete overhaul
	+ Mobs disappearing cause exceptions
	+ It contains Thread.Sleep() and many more sins.
    + It runs 'open loop', if you get interrupted while interacting, it counts it towards its completion goal
    + It needs to be recast in terms of TreeHooks, since it expects to act during combat.
       The old technique this behavior uses is glitchy.
	+ Here is an example: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-8.html#post1092277
	+ InteractWith can't see Hargan Bronzewing to buy riding training:

* KillUntilComplete
	+ Gets hung up if in combat, and nobody attacking--need to go on the offensive
	+ Behavior 'stands around' far too much
	+ Needs a HuntingGrounds element
	+ DeathKnight start area: "Nowhere to Run And Nowhere to Hide" is a good test

	+ The behavior can kill all the Gnomes in the immediate area, then run out of things to kill.  Since there
	  are distance limits on the range of ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType(), the 'target list' goes empty
	  and causes this problem.  We need to rewrite the behavior to have the ball follow a particular path when there
	  are no more targets in the immediate area.  The path should take us to more targets so
	  ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType() can be re-populated.
	+ May need to put a "gnomes killed" timer in place to abandon the current vehicle, and go fetch a fresh one


TO RETIRE:

* IntoTheRealmOfShadows.cs
