TODO
====
* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
 
* ButtonPressOnChat, (request from Laria):
	hey there, could you extend buttonpressonchat with a small auraid check,
	"if i have this aura, don't interact with gameobject/npc anymore because we already are in the event"?
	it also might need fixes due to new actionbar code,
	for me wow says "you can't do that" and no buttons seem to be pressed

* InteractWith testing needed:
	+ Needs to give reasons it is "waiting for mob to spawn"
	+ This needs to be convered to new InteractWith: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-8.html#post1092277
	+ Old InteractWith can't see Hargan Bronzewing to buy riding training--see if problem still exists with new InteractWith:

* KillUntilComplete
	+ Gets hung up if in combat, and nobody attacking--need to go on the offensive
	+ Behavior 'stands around' far too much
	+ Needs a HuntingGrounds element
	+ DeathKnight start area: "Nowhere to Run And Nowhere to Hide" is a good test

* LoadProfile is not constructing relative path names correctly:

* MyCTM
	+ Needs to take a path of points
	+ Needs to gracefully recover from combat situations

* UseItemOn
	+ Doesn't re-face target on which to use item, if it gets in combat
	+ See Tumbum's report here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-support/114206-useitemon-singular-doesnt-face-target.html#post1111161

* UseTransport
	+ Bugs reported by Bengan12 that started with the 5.2 WoWclient drop
	+ More info here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-support/111954-usetransport-cs.html

	+ The behavior can kill all the Gnomes in the immediate area, then run out of things to kill.  Since there
	  are distance limits on the range of ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType(), the 'target list' goes empty
	  and causes this problem.  We need to rewrite the behavior to have the ball follow a particular path when there
	  are no more targets in the immediate area.  The path should take us to more targets so
	  ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType() can be re-populated.
	+ May need to put a "gnomes killed" timer in place to abandon the current vehicle, and go fetch a fresh one
	
* 52781-Persuasive Strike
	+ ?


KICK'S PROFILES:
================
* Change PullDistance="25"/"30" to PullDistance="original"
	+ This one's going to take a while--its half a million lines of profile code to scour.

* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
	+ In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs are not taken out first.
	+ Need to beef up EscortGroup to allow for target priority
	+ Have Kick replace 30625-FourWinds-StudentsNoMore.cs with EscortGroup.cs
	
* Need to sweep through all profiles and remove as much CTM things as possible.
	CTM doesn't unstuck and causes grief.

* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.

* Goblin profiles are buggy for Huntards (from Kick):

NEEDED QUEST BEHAVIORS:
=======================
* Actively Avoid Mobs
	* You Can't Take'Em Alone & Hold the Line
		+ Need to avoid the Horrid Abomination (36231) while doing Hold he Line

* Behavior to completely disable Combat Routine (and turn it back on)
	* Needed for pet-based classes in Worgen and Goblin starting zones?
		
* General Pickpocket behavior
	* Similar to new InteractWith or CollectThings
	* Has a 'hunting ground'
	* Needs to guarantee stealth
	* Needs to guarantee approaching mob from behind
	* Use distract if necessary

* Mobile tank vehicle behavior that can actually aim at targets

* Stationary Cannon (Worgen starting area--level 5-ish)
	* For By Blood and Ash
		+ Mount Rebel Cannon (35317)
		+ Just aim on Bloodfang Stalker(35229)
		+ Use Button 1 (Rebel Cannon, http://www.wowhead.com/spell=67279) 
		+ Prefer nearest mobs


GENERAL PROFILE ISSUES:
=======================
* Stay on Apoc/Nesox about getting unified QB directory DLL.
	We can't reuse any code until this problem is solved.

* Currently underwater nav is handled by each behavior, and slightly differently.
	Any chance of using Flightor as the nav while swimming?
