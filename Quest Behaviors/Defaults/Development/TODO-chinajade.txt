* AbandonQuest
	+ Needs a feature to jettison all quests we've left behind.
		This is a tricky proposition, but needed to prevent incomplete quests from cluttering our logs.

* BarrelHook needs to unhook itself if specific quests aren't in our log.

* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
 
* ButtonPressOnChat, (request from Laria):
	hey there, could you extend buttonpressonchat with a small auraid check,
	"if i have this aura, don't interact with gameobject/npc anymore because we already are in the event"?
	it also might need fixes due to new actionbar code,
	for me wow says "you can't do that" and no buttons seem to be pressed

* CollectThings
	* Needs to be adapted to new QuestBehaviorCore framework
	* Needs to tell why its 'waiting for mobs to respawn'

* CombatUseItemOnV2
	+ hi chinajade, im at work , thats why im using forum PM
		the CombatUseItemOnV2 its realy better than CombatUseItemOn and i always try use it but in my opinion have one problem than old CombatUseItemOn dont have its the simple use item.
		Some quests request toon to use item (some on mob some just use it) but dont apply aura, examples
		use item= remove elite status
		use item= change mob
		use item=char obtain 1 flask
		use item= etc etc
		the old CombatUseItemOn can do that but... cant add 2 or more Hotspots, and the important thing cant work underwater
		your CombatUseItemOnV2 can have 2 or more hotspots ( wich is amazing) can go underwater ( wich is magnifique) but cant work without aura.
		what about if you add one option like SingleUseItem="True" and behavior ignore auras etc like this:
		mobhealth=30% usetimes="10" SingleUseItem="True"

QB will use item 10 times on mob when have less than 30% and close behavior after that 

* InteractWith testing needed:
	+ Rework InteractWith to use items and interact during combat
		A good test is "Nature's Repisal" a level 7 Night Elf quest conducted in a cave with bad LoS issues.
		Use Natfoth profile and switch out UseItemTargetLocation for this quest.
	+ If MobState="Dead" specified, and alive targets in area, help them get "Dead" so we can interact.
	+ Target not being temporarily blacklisted after UsingItem.
	+ This needs to be convered to new InteractWith: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-8.html#post1092277
	+ Needs a timer that blacklists target for a bit, if it can't be interacted with within a reasonable period of time.
	+ Needs to help out with "randomized" daily quests: SelectGossipAvailableQuest(GetNumGossipAvailableQuests())
	+ found a problem with interactwith, its not a big deal nothing hurgent but isnt working like expected. Some time the normal turnin doesnt work because mob/object
	  its too far away and bot cant reach it, usualy i use interactwith to open the window then i use lua run macro click gossipcompletequest. tested the interactwith with option to turn in quest  and ranged=15, bot still want run to near object (distance 4 i think), so bot ignored my range 15 with option to turn in
		How do you turn in from 15 feet away when interact range is 4.75 feet?
		some mobs/object doesnt work with short distance
		for turnin quest, let me explain think about one large stone the stone have like 30 yards FAT, the turn in cant reach middle of stone
		because midle its 15 yards away from bot
		this works:
			<CustomBehavior File="InteractWith" MobId="195600" ObjectType="GameObject" Range="14" X="-183.6784" Y="1117.673" Z="90.28101" />
			<CustomBehavior File="RunMacro" Macro="/click QuestFrameCompleteQuestButton" NumOfTimes="1" WaitTime="1000" />
		this not
			<CustomBehavior File="InteractWith" MobId="195600" ObjectType="GameObject" Range="14" InteractByQuestFrameDisposition="Complete" X="-183.6784" Y="1117.673" Z="90.28101" />
		if i use the InteractByQuestFrameDisposition="Complete" with range=14 doesnt work
		if i use only interact works
	  (Requested to see log next time it happens--could be exceptions being thrown from anywhere).
	+ Giwin claims InteractWith doesn't work underwater
		+ See: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/developer-forum/116066-interactwith-not-working-underwater.html#post1126570
		+ Example he gave Frederick's Fish Fancy - Quest - World of Warcraft (http://www.thebuddyforum.com/redirect-to/?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wowhead.com%2Fquest%3D27450%2Ffredericks-fish-fancy).

	+ TheBrodieMan 2013Apr14
		came across an issue with IW while coding the PvP quests in IoT. Theres a bomb that needs to be placed by IW'ing with a mark on a wall.
		he wall has a lip over it. Im not sure if its the proximity to water or the lip, bu IW won't click on it, says "NoLoS" even though it 
		is clickable (and seeable) from where we stand. Problem persists both water walking, floating, and swimming.
		any way to "ignore" LoS so it will click regardless?
		Think i found the issue: Object saying interact range is 2 yds. I have Range set to 5 in the CB. Closest you can get to it is 3.5 yds
		(wall and environment prevents closer) and its still clickable...am i screwed cuz of WoW?
	+ TheBrodieMan 2013Apr15
		rechecked my IW code for 2 click item use. Range was set to 15. Unfortunately it moves to point blank before attempting.
		
* KillUntilComplete
	+ Gets hung up if in combat, and nobody attacking--need to go on the offensive
	+ Behavior 'stands around' far too much
	+ Needs a HuntingGrounds element
	+ DeathKnight start area: "Nowhere to Run And Nowhere to Hide" is a good test
	+ Needs to clear mobs that will aggro otw to our target mob.
	+ Needs to pick targets based on SurfacePathDistance
	+ Needs to define complete as "KillCount"

* LoadProfile is not constructing relative path names correctly:

* UseItemOn
	+ Doesn't re-face target on which to use item, if it gets in combat
	+ See Tumbum's report here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-support/114206-useitemon-singular-doesnt-face-target.html#post1111161

* UseTransport
	+ Bugs reported by Bengan12 that started with the 5.2 WoWclient drop

* VehicleMover
	+ http://www.wowhead.com/quest=13560
	[9:55:55 AM] Natfoth (Nathaniel Farthington): it would never finish, no matter what I had the count set to,
	no matter if I removed all the quest stuff, IsDone never passed unless the quest was completed with a Quest ID
	[2:43:57 PM] Chinajade: Good, a relatively low one.  Remember what race/class you were?

	+ http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-5.html#post1103008
	+ The behavior can kill all the Gnomes in the immediate area, then run out of things to kill.  Since there
	  are distance limits on the range of ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType(), the 'target list' goes empty
	  and causes this problem.  We need to rewrite the behavior to have the ball follow a particular path when there
	  are no more targets in the immediate area.  The path should take us to more targets so
	  ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType() can be re-populated.
	+ May need to put a "gnomes killed" timer in place to abandon the current vehicle, and go fetch a fresh one
	
* 29918-FourWinds-ALessonInBravery.cs
	+ People report dying while riding the birds--looks like maybe a Singular issue.  May need a mini combat routine since bird may count as a 'vehicle'.
	    If so, steal it from Monk 1-12 behavior (that does pole dancing stuff): 29663-PandaStarter-TheLessonoftheBalancedRock.cs.

	+ ?


QUESTBEHAVIORCORE FRAMEWORK
===========================
* The UserSettings/OnBotStop interferes with QuestBehaviorCore's OnBotStop.  Figure out a way to process
	events from various hooks installed at different times by different processes in the correct order.

* When moving to hunting ground center, and no other waypoints, we need to randomize location

* UtilityBehavior_MoveTo
	+ Do some testing with flying quests like Pomfruit Pickup (http://www.wowhead.com/quest=30231)
	+ If flying and make it 'indoors', land before continuing.
	+ Can Flightor be used to do underwater navigation?

* Do we need a Data/SharedResources.xml file to augment IsInCompetition() calculations?


KICK'S PROFILES:
================
* Change PullDistance="25"/"30" to PullDistance="original"
	+ This one's going to take a while--its half a million lines of profile code to scour.

* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
	+ In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs are not taken out first.
	+ Need to beef up EscortGroup to allow for target priority
	+ Have Kick replace 30625-FourWinds-StudentsNoMore.cs with EscortGroup.cs
	
* Need to sweep through all profiles and remove as much CTM things as possible.
	CTM doesn't unstuck and causes grief.

* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.

* Goblin profiles are buggy for Huntards (from Kick):

* "Finding your Center" (31) needs a behavior developed for it (ally, jade forest)


NEEDED QUEST BEHAVIORS:
=======================
* Actively Avoid Mobs
	* You Can't Take'Em Alone & Hold the Line
		+ Need to avoid the Horrid Abomination (36231) while doing Hold he Line

* Behavior to completely disable Combat Routine (and turn it back on)
	* Needed for pet-based classes in Worgen and Goblin starting zones?
		
* General Pickpocket behavior
	* Similar to new InteractWith or CollectThings
	* Has a 'hunting ground'
	* Needs to guarantee stealth
	* Needs to guarantee approaching mob from behind
	* Use distract if necessary

* HearthOrHoofIt
	* Needs to do inter-continental travel via instructions in a Data file.
	* Needs to use the mage's/druid/deathknight abilities if possible.
	* Use hearthstone if not on cooldown, and it makes sense.

* Mobile tank vehicle behavior that can actually aim at targets

* PartyRendezvous
	* Might be useful in dailies
	* Details here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/developer-forum/113041-setting-up-raf-questing.html#post1101781

* PathTo
	* Use QuestBehaviorCore composite navigator
	* Allow Combat, or not
	* Allow Rest/Healing self or not
	* Allow pet to be put away, or not
	* Allow mounting, or not
	* Should deprecate MyCTM, NoCombatMoveTo, RunLikeHell

* Stationary Cannon (Worgen starting area--level 5-ish)
	* For By Blood and Ash
		+ Mount Rebel Cannon (35317)
		+ Just aim on Bloodfang Stalker(35229)
		+ Use Button 1 (Rebel Cannon, http://www.wowhead.com/spell=67279) 
		+ Prefer nearest mobs

* UseItem
	* Needs to retry the item if it is a form of a beacon (e.g., Hearthstone, Kirin Tor recall, etc).

* WaitForCompetitionToClear
	* Waits for players to clear a position
	* Should exclude the bot 'wait spot'
	* Needs a maximum time limit we're willing to wait.


GENERAL PROFILE ISSUES (KICK):
==============================
* Currently underwater nav is handled by each behavior, and slightly differently.
	Any chance of using Flightor as the nav while swimming?

GENERAL PROFILE ISSUES (THEBRODIEMAN):
======================================
* INTERACTWITH
	* I had some trouble in the past. again didnt know who to bring it up to...ended up doing a workaround in a plugin.
	  Tried interacting with statues. On right-click they should either die, or attack you. InteractWith couldn't/wouldn't
	  interact with the mob, and would sit endlessly...have you heard of this issue yet?
		+ Hard as a Rock/No Stone Unturned (two quests, identical requirements, neutral faction)
		+ QuestIds 30304, 30299 respectively MobId="63447" MobId2="63556"

* PERFORMTRADESKILLON
  [5:24:32 PM] TheBrodieMan: oh oh oh PerformTradeskillOn has been acting up. i need to test it myself
  but it seems alot of people it has been trying to parse the spellbook rather than the tradeskill window.
  i dont know if its UI related yet, but its been since 5.2
	+ Cloud Serpent dailies, there are 2 quests


HBCORE BUGS
===========
* Sell/Repair runs
	Vendor runs can happen at any time.  The repair run may be done at a time the profile
	has temporarily turned off the use of mounts.   When HBcore decides a vendor run is
	needed, it should make certain UseMount is turned on, and PullDistance set to something sane
	during the run.  The original values should be restored when the run is complete.
