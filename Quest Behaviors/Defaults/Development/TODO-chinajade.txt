TODO
====
* UtilityBehaviorPS_MoveTo
	+ If Navigator* in use, and flying--land immediately.

* AbandonQuest
	+ Needs a feature to jettison all quests we've left behind.
		This is a tricky proposition, but needed to prevent incomplete quests from cluttering our logs.

* BarrelHook needs to unhook itself if specific quests aren't in our log.

* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
 
* ButtonPressOnChat, (request from Laria):
	hey there, could you extend buttonpressonchat with a small auraid check,
	"if i have this aura, don't interact with gameobject/npc anymore because we already are in the event"?
	it also might need fixes due to new actionbar code,
	for me wow says "you can't do that" and no buttons seem to be pressed

* CollectThings
	* Needs to be adapted to new QuestBehaviorCore framework
	* Needs to tell why its 'waiting for mobs to respawn' 

* EscortGroup
	* Needs to be adapted to new QuestBehaviorCore framework

* GetOutOfGroundEffectsAndAuras
	loving the new moveoutofaura CB, but I have one request
	for instance stonecore mount boss has 2 abilities 
	but, the lava fissures spawn, which spawn lava something ie fire on the ground
	and the boss doesnt actually cause it, hence it wont avoid it
	would it be possible to add 4th option to move out of an effect no matter how the effect gets there

* InteractWith testing needed:
	+ InteractByCastingSpellOn & make sure it works for "cast spell on 'self'"
	+ InteractByCollectingItemId
	+ BlacklistInteractTarget needs to emit message as to why blacklisted (but, warning or info or debug?--it varies).
	+ This needs to be converted to new InteractWith: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-8.html#post1092277
	+ Giwin claims InteractWith doesn't work underwater
		+ See: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/developer-forum/116066-interactwith-not-working-underwater.html#post1126570
		+ Example he gave Frederick's Fish Fancy - Quest - World of Warcraft (http://www.thebuddyforum.com/redirect-to/?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wowhead.com%2Fquest%3D27450%2Ffredericks-fish-fancy).
	+ TheBrodieMan 2013Apr15
		rechecked my IW code for 2 click item use. Range was set to 15. Unfortunately it moves to point blank before attempting.
	+ Some Inns will bind without gossip, and don't offer wares--need to deal with this.
	+ See if you can get to "wares" screen of Innkeeper without requiring gossip.
		
* KillUntilComplete
	+ Gets hung up if in combat, and nobody attacking--need to go on the offensive
	+ Behavior 'stands around' far too much
	+ Needs a HuntingGrounds element
	+ DeathKnight start area: "Nowhere to Run And Nowhere to Hide" is a good test
	+ Needs to clear mobs that will aggro otw to our target mob.
	+ Needs to pick targets based on SurfacePathDistance
	+ Needs to define complete as "KillCount"

* LoadProfile is not constructing relative path names correctly:

* SlayTheFools
	* Retire KillUntilComplete in favor of SlayTheFools
	* Dox: "Mostly useful when in toon is thrown into combat (due to environment), but nothing is attacking us
	* Beef up to take a HuntingGrounds

* UseItemOn
	+ Doesn't re-face target on which to use item, if it gets in combat
	+ See Tumbum's report here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-support/114206-useitemon-singular-doesnt-face-target.html#post1111161

* UseTransport
	+ Bugs reported by Bengan12 that started with the 5.2 WoWclient drop
	+ More info here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-support/111954-usetransport-cs.html

	+ http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-5.html#post1103008
	+ The behavior can kill all the Gnomes in the immediate area, then run out of things to kill.  Since there
	  are distance limits on the range of ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType(), the 'target list' goes empty
	  and causes this problem.  We need to rewrite the behavior to have the ball follow a particular path when there
	  are no more targets in the immediate area.  The path should take us to more targets so
	  ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType() can be re-populated.
	+ May need to put a "gnomes killed" timer in place to abandon the current vehicle, and go fetch a fresh one
	
* 29918-FourWinds-ALessonInBravery.cs
	+ People report dying while riding the birds--looks like maybe a Singular issue.  May need a mini combat routine since bird may count as a 'vehicle'.
	    If so, steal it from Monk 1-12 behavior (that does pole dancing stuff): 29663-PandaStarter-TheLessonoftheBalancedRock.cs.
	+ Example: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-5.html#post1132773

* 52781-Persuasive Strike
	+ ?


QUESTBEHAVIORCORE FRAMEWORK
===========================
* UtilityBehaviorPS_DescendForDismount() needs to throttle its output messages.

* UtilityBehaviorPS & UtilityBehaviorSeq needs to be their own classes rather than part of QuestBehaviorCore

* The UserSettings/OnBotStop interferes with QuestBehaviorCore's OnBotStop.  Figure out a way to process
	events from various hooks installed at different times by different processes in the correct order.

* When moving to hunting ground center, and no other waypoints, we need to randomize location

* UtilityBehavior_MoveTo
	+ Do some testing with flying quests like Pomfruit Pickup (http://www.wowhead.com/quest=30231)
	+ Can Flightor be used to do underwater navigation?

* Do we need a Data/SharedResources.xml file to augment IsInCompetition() calculations?

* Need a way to capture 'reasons' of exclusion in FindBestTarget() methods and the predicates they use.

* Need support for 'special instructions'
	+ UseItemWheMeHasAura
	+ UseItemWhenMeMissingAura
	+ UseItemOnMobWhenHasAura
	+ UseItemOnMobWhenMissingAura
	+ etc.


PROFILES:
=========
* Deepholm: Elemental Energy
	+ See problem report here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/50549-kicks-mega-profile-packs-1-90-a-4.html#post1142895

* Change PullDistance="25"/"30" to PullDistance="original"
	+ This one's going to take a while--its half a million lines of profile code to scour.

* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
	+ In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs are not taken out first.
	+ Need to beef up EscortGroup to allow for target priority
	+ Have Kick replace 30625-FourWinds-StudentsNoMore.cs with EscortGroup.cs
	
* Need to sweep through all profiles and remove as much CTM things as possible.
	CTM doesn't unstuck and causes grief.

* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.

* Goblin profiles are buggy for Huntards (from Kick):

* [A - Quest] EK 12-58 [Kick].xml
	+ Quest "Ancient Protectors" (http://www.wowhead.com/quest=27793)
		* InteractWith "cant' see" the Warden (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46768)
		* <CustomBehavior File="InteractWith" QuestId="27793" MobId="46768" GossipOptions="1" MobState="Alive" X="-6920.016" Y="-3446.434" Z="197.6488" />

* "Finding your Center" (31) needs a behavior developed for it (ally, jade forest)

* Ringo escort in Un'goro. (Cava)
	+ Ringo apparently doesn't have auras to tell when the canteen can and cannot be used.
	+ If you try to use the canteen at the wrong time, IW will blacklist mob after a few times, because the canteen use is 'interrupted'.

NEEDED QUEST BEHAVIORS:
=======================
* Actively Avoid Mobs
	* You Can't Take'Em Alone & Hold the Line
		+ Need to avoid the Horrid Abomination (36231) while doing Hold he Line

* Behavior to completely disable Combat Routine (and turn it back on)
	* Needed for pet-based classes in Worgen and Goblin starting zones?
		
* General Pickpocket behavior

	* Has a 'hunting ground'
	* Needs to guarantee stealth
	* Needs to guarantee approaching mob from behind
	* Use distract if necessary

* HearthOrHoofIt
	* Needs to do inter-continental travel via instructions in a Data file.
	* Needs to use the mage's/druid/deathknight abilities if possible.
	* Use hearthstone if not on cooldown, and it makes sense.

* Mobile tank vehicle behavior that can actually aim at targets

* PartyRendezvous
	* Might be useful in dailies
	* Details here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/developer-forum/113041-setting-up-raf-questing.html#post1101781

* PathTo
	* Use QuestBehaviorCore composite navigator
	* Allow Combat, or not
	* Allow Rest/Healing self or not
	* Allow pet to be put away, or not
	* Allow mounting, or not
	* Should deprecate MyCTM, NoCombatMoveTo, RunLikeHell

* ProfileTuner
	* EchoTiger's idea from here: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/developer-forum/118745-suggestion-profile-option-menu.html#post1149747

* Stationary Cannon (Worgen starting area--level 5-ish)
	* For By Blood and Ash
		+ Mount Rebel Cannon (35317)

		+ Use Button 1 (Rebel Cannon, http://www.wowhead.com/spell=67279) 
		+ Prefer nearest mobs

* UseItem
	* Needs to retry the item if it is a form of a beacon (e.g., Hearthstone, Kirin Tor recall, etc).

* WaitForCompetitionToClear
	* Waits for players to clear a position
	* Should exclude the bot 'wait spot'
	* Needs a maximum time limit we're willing to wait.


GENERAL PROFILE ISSUES (KICK):
==============================
* Currently underwater nav is handled by each behavior, and slightly differently.
	Any chance of using Flightor as the nav while swimming?

* Uldum
	[06:54:41.338 N] Enabling Check at 08:54:41
	[06:54:41.338 D] Checktimer has Finished its Total wait of 5 Minutes, Enabling Item Check for next Opportunity
	[06:54:41.338 N] Will Run Next Check At 08:59:41

	[06:54:56.688 N] [InteractWith-v419(info) @line 890]: Waiting for Salhet to respawn.
	Excluded Units:
		Salhet [NonNavigable]


GENERAL PROFILE ISSUES (THEBRODIEMAN):
======================================
* INTERACTWITH
	* I had some trouble in the past. again didnt know who to bring it up to...ended up doing a workaround in a plugin.
	  Tried interacting with statues. On right-click they should either die, or attack you. InteractWith couldn't/wouldn't
	  interact with the mob, and would sit endlessly...have you heard of this issue yet?
		+ Hard as a Rock/No Stone Unturned (two quests, identical requirements, neutral faction)
		+ QuestIds 30304, 30299 respectively MobId="63447" MobId2="63556"

* PERFORMTRADESKILLON
  [5:24:32 PM] TheBrodieMan: oh oh oh PerformTradeskillOn has been acting up. i need to test it myself
  but it seems alot of people it has been trying to parse the spellbook rather than the tradeskill window.
  i dont know if its UI related yet, but its been since 5.2
	+ Cloud Serpent dailies, there are 2 quests


HBCORE BUGS
===========
* Sell/Repair runs
	Vendor runs can happen at any time.  The repair run may be done at a time the profile
	has temporarily turned off the use of mounts.   When HBcore decides a vendor run is
	needed, it should make certain UseMount is turned on, and PullDistance set to something sane
	during the run.  The original values should be restored when the run is complete.
