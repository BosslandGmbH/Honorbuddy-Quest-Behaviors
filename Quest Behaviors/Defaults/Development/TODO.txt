TODO:
* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
  In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs
  are not taken out first.
* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.

* ButtonPressOnChat, (request from Laria):
	hey there, could you extend buttonpressonchat with a small auraid check,
	"if i have this aura, don't interact with gameobject/npc anymore because we already are in the event"?
	it also might need fixes due to new actionbar code,
	for me wow says "you can't do that" and no buttons seem to be pressed

* Goblin profiles are buggy for Huntards (from Kick):

	+ The behavior can kill all the Gnomes in the immediate area, then run out of things to kill.  Since there
	  are distance limits on the range of ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType(), the 'target list' goes empty
	  and causes this problem.  We need to rewrite the behavior to have the ball follow a particular path when there
	  are no more targets in the immediate area.  The path should take us to more targets so
	  ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType() can be re-populated.
