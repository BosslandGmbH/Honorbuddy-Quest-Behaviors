TODO:
* "Students No More" needs to focus on the eggs that heal the boss.
  In Kick's thread a few people have reported the inability to kill the boss when the eggs
  are not taken out first.
* ButtonPress/* behaviors need to take the CombatRoutine out of the equation with TreeHooks.
* Kick's Hyjal "Mental Training": Needs to use ButtonPressOn* behavior instead of specific one.
* UserDialog needs to log which button the user clicked on to close the dialog
